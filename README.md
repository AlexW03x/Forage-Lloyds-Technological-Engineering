# Forage Lloyds Bank Technical Engineering
## Mortgage Calculator Project

> I designed a beautiful UI that stores user input in session caches where users follow a breadcrumb styled portal with pagination and helpful tooltips providing a lot of interactivity throughout and clarity on each input field. Users will be greeted with simple english and nice charts to demonstrate values of their mortgage and I also managed to design the Lloyds Bank navigation UI too to go with this.
